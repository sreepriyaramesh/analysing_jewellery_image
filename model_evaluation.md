## Scenario 2

The best way to tackle this task is by using multimodal vision-language models that can understand both images and text at the same time. These models merge techniques from computer vision and natural language processing, making them great for tasks that involve analysing images and describing them with text.
One impressive model for this job is called BLIP-2. It's designed to handle both visual and textual information together. It has highly effective on tasks like describing images, answering questions about them, and solving visual problems.
1. **Data Preparation:** 
 - Image Preprocessing: Retrieve images from cloud object storage, resize them to a consistent resolution, and perform any necessary normalization or data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
 - Data Labelling: Extract relevant information from the database, such as materials, design attributes, and categorizations, and associate them with the corresponding images to create a labelled dataset.
 - Dataset Splitting: Split the labelled dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation.
2. **Model Selection and Training:**
 - Fine-tuned the BLIP-2  model on the prepared dataset of jewellery images and associated labels. During fine-tuning, the model will learn to associate visual features from the jewellery images with the corresponding textual information provided.
3. **Cloud-Based Deployment:**
 - To ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance, its better to deploy on a cloud platform, such as Google Cloud Platform or AWS.  
   
  The deployment process could involve the following steps:

 - Cloud Function or Cloud Run: Since the data is stored in cloud, set up a Cloud Function or Cloud Run service to orchestrate the image processing pipeline. 
 - Model Deployment: Deploy the fine-tuned multimodal model on a scalable compute infrastructure, such as Google Cloud AI Platform or AWS, for inference.
 - Database Integration: Integrate with the existing database to retrieve and store product information generated by the model.
 - Output Storage: Store the processed images/results in an output cloud storage bucket for further analysis.
 - Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on a held-out test set, and iterative refinement may be performed by adjusting hyperparameters, augmenting the dataset, or exploring different model architectures if necessary.
4. **User Interface and Integration:**
 - To streamline the process for artisans to list the products, a user-friendly interface would be developed, allowing them to upload jewellery images and receive automatically generated product descriptions and specifications. This interface could be integrated with the existing marketplace platform, providing a seamless experience for artisans and customers alike.
5. **Monitoring and Continuous Improvement:**
 - Continuously monitor the performance of the AI system and gather feedback from artisans and customers. Periodically evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set and iterate on the training process by adjusting hyperparameters, augmenting the dataset, or exploring different model architectures if necessary.
